# adminLTE vueJS template

> An adminLTE template for VueJS based on the full-featured Webpack setup with hot-reload, lint-on-save, unit testing & css extraction (maybe not everything will still working after I have updated components).

> This template is Vue 2.0 compatible. There is no Vue 1.x compatible template, sorry, but feel free to do one.

## Documentation

- [For Webpack template](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack): common questions specific to this template are answered and each part is described in greater detail (webpack is at the origin of this template, so the doc will be almost valid)
- [For Vue 2.0](http://vuejs.org/guide/): general information about how to work with Vue, not specific to this template

## Usage

This is a project template for [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli). **It is recommended to use npm 3+ for a more efficient dependency tree.**

``` bash
$ npm install -g vue-cli
$ vue init phantase/adminLte-vue-cli-template my-project
$ cd my-project
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```
